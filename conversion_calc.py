Create a calculator that converts Celsius to Fahrenheit and Fahrenheit to Celsius.
Formulas: 
F = C * (9/5) + 32
C = (F - 32) * (5/9)

* Create a function to convert F to C
* Create a function to convert C to F
* Ask the user the current temperature
* Ask the user if that is in F or C.
* If it is F, run the function to convert it to C and output to the console.
* If it is C, run the function to convert it to F and output to the console.
* Create a loop that asks the user if they would like to convert another temperature. If so, run again, else exit.
Submission:
Commit your code to github and submit the link along with screenshots of your code and it running.
