"""
Complete "BPA Warm-up  - Temp Conversion 1" first.

Now that you've created a conversion calculator, it's time to record the data. 
Write code to check if "temps_recorded.txt" exists. If it doesn't create it.
Add a function to your code that records the temperature inputted (in F or C), the conversion temp (in F or C) and the date/time it was recorded to the temps_recorded.txt file.
Your function should append temps_recorded.txt to keep a running log of the temps recorded and not overwrite previous recording.
